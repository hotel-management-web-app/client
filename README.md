## Introduction

This is a hotel management system designed to help hotel owners manage their properties and customers make reservations. The application can be customized to suit a variety of properties by adding floors and rooms.

For guests, the system provides a user-friendly interface to browse offers and make reservations. Additionally, guests can contact the hotel through a dedicated contact page.
